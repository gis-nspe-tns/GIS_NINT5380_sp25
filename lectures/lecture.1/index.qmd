## Spatial Thinking - definition and introduction

<br>

Spatial thinking is defined as the knowledge, skills, and habits of mind to use concepts of space, tools of representation like maps and graphs, and processes of reasoning to organize and solve problems.^[Downs and de Souza 2005]

## Spatial Thinking - Connections to Mental Maps

*Mental maps are a way of combining our objective knowledge of places in addition to our subjective perceptions, or opinions, of locations around the world.*

## Spatial Thinking - Concepts of Space

- Space, space-time, object/field, place
- Primitives of identity: 
  - object, container, boundary, shape, texture
- Primitive spatial relations: 
  - static location - distance, direction, distribution
  - connection
  - dynamic motion - flow, force, intersection/collision

## Spatial Thinking - Spatial Reasoning

- Extracting spatial structures 
  - boundary; pattern; cluster; center; path; surface; network; sequence; hierarchy; region
- Performing spatial transformations 
  - perspective; rotation; 3D > 2D; scale; interpolation; generalization
- Drawing functional inferences
  - spatial correlation; spatial dependence; heterogeneity; extrapolation; prediction; causation

## Spatial Thinking - Asking Geographic Questions {.scrollable}

- **Questions about geographic location:**
  - Where is it?
  - Why is it here or there?
  - How much of it is here or there?
  
- **Questions about geographic distribution:**
    - Is it distributed locally or globally?
    - Is it spatially clustered or dispersed?
    - Where are the boundaries?
    - Questions about geographic association:

- **What else is near it?**
    - What else occurs with it?
    - What is absent in its presence?

- **Questions about geographic interaction:**
    - Is it linked to something else?
    - What is the nature of this association?
    - How much interaction occurs between the locations?

- **Questions about geographic change:**
    - Has it always been here?
    - How has it changed over time and space?
    - What causes its diffusion or contraction?

## Maps - Historical Frameworks

- Any straight line on a Mercator projection map is a line of constant true bearing relative to true north that enables a navigator to plot a straight-line course.  This is also termed a Rhumb Line or Loxodrome.

## John Snow's 'Broad Street Pump Map'


- Early example of (Modern) epidemilogical mapping

- Fits within the larger study and analysis of the distribution (who, when, and where)

- Excellent example of Waldo Tobler's **The First Law of Geography** (1969) whereby *everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things*.

## GIS - The Quantitative Approach 

- Prevalence:

  - 80% of the worldâ€™s data includes some kind of spatial aspect, 80% of data has a location component, 80% of data possesses a geographic reference, 80% of transactional data has a location component.*

- Maturity & accessibility:

## GIS - Definitions {background="#43464B" background-image="index_files/img/vector1.png"}

- Geographic
  - i.e. the *geometry* or *spatial* component of data


## GIS - Definitions {background="#43464B" background-image="index_files/img/vector2.png"}

- Information
  - i.e. common, colloquial formats, often *tabular* of **attribute data**

## GIS - Definitions {background="#43464B" background-image="index_files/img/vector3.png"}

- System
  - processing *input* data to *output* meaningful results, often presented as cartographic output, i.e. maps

## GIS - Definitions {background="#43464B" background-image="index_files/img/vector4.png"}

- Valid GIS data inputs are generally defined by two main models - Vector & Raster


## GIS - Definitions {background="#43464B" background-image="index_files/img/vector4.png"}

- The vector model is defined by points, lines and polygons; this model is typically used to represent discrete phenomena, i.e. 'bounded' or defined by an edge.


## GIS - Terminology

- Feature
  - In a GIS, a physical object or location of an event. Features can be points (a tree or a traffic accident), lines (a road or river), or areas (a forest or a parking lot).

## GIS - Terminology

- Geometry
  - Geometry deals with the measures and properties of points, lines and surfaces. In a GIS, geometry is used to represent the spatial component of geographic features.

Reference: [Overpass Turbo -Feature](https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/19Y9)
:::

## GIS - Terminology

- Attributes
  - Organized by **Record** & **Row**; Record is a logical unit of data in a file, and the Row is positioned horizontally and contains a series of thematic descriptors of various data types.

## GIS - Terminology

- Together, a **Table** consists of a set of data elements that has a horizontal dimension (rows) and a vertical dimension (columns) in a relational database system. A table has a specified number of columns but can have any number of rows. A table is often called a relation. Columns are also referred to Fields.

![](index_files/img/attribute_row_table.png){.absolute top="420" left="150" width="780"}

## GIS - Terminology

- Attribute Data organized via hierarchy

## GIS - Terminology

- Attribute Data at its root is structured as **primitive data types**

## GIS - Terminology

- Map Scale
    - John Snow's Map was a decidedly **Large Scale** analysis in an urban environment.

## GIS - Terminology {background="#43464B" background-image="index_files/img/stack.png"}

- In GIS, multiple vector & raster spatial datasets are organized by a 'stacking principle' referred to as **Overlay**.
